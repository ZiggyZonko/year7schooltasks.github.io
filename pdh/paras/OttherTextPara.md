Things that Negatively impacted the way people support their physical health is Isolation, Social Distancing and Masks. Isolation prevents anyone from leaving their house with COVID-19 symptoms thus the uprise of cardio indoors like weights and simple excercises. This means that you can't go to a gym or see a trainer to help your physical health. Social Distancing also impacted the way we get excercise and Social Distancing is another impact on people going to gyms or sseeing personal or group trainers. Social Distnacing is a good protective strategy but can impact people's physical and sometimes mental health. Masks are another reason why they impacted people's mental and physical health as you can not breathe in them properly from my experience and wearing that all the time is quite annoying. But trying to run or do excercise outside with it on is the same as running with a plastic bag on your head; You Will suffocate. This impacted people's breathing and overall didn't make COVID a fun period of time for anyone.</p>
